### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Arthur! :grinning:

Currently studying at EPITECH, I enjoy programming, and discovering new technologies.

So far, I've programmed in C, C++, Python, PHP (w/ Symfony Framework) and I'm looking forward to use other programming languages

I'm also part of the pedagogical team of the school I study at. :books:
I love teaching stuffs, talking about memory management and debate on ways to solve problems!
